      <h2>Top Attractions in Florence</h2>
      <p>Begin your exploration at the <strong>Duomo di Firenze</strong>, one of the world’s most magnificent cathedrals. Climb its 463 steps to enjoy breathtaking views of the city. Visit the <strong>Uffizi Gallery</strong> to admire masterpieces by Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael. Don’t forget <strong>Ponte Vecchio</strong>, Florence’s oldest bridge, known for its glittering jewelry shops.</p>

      <p>Beyond the big landmarks, explore smaller gems like the <em>Mercato Centrale</em> for fresh food, or the <em>Oltrarno</em> neighborhood, where artisans still make leather, paper, and jewelry by hand. Every corner tells a story.</p>

      <h2>Local Food and Dining</h2>
      <p>Italian meals are an experience, not just a necessity. Start your day with a cappuccino and pastry. Lunch often includes a light pasta or <em>panino</em> (sandwich), and dinner may feature Tuscan specialties like <em>pappa al pomodoro</em> or <em>bistecca alla fiorentina</em>. Remember: Italians rarely drink cappuccino after 11 a.m. and dinner usually starts around 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>For budget travelers, bakeries and small trattorias offer “<em>menu del giorno</em>” — a fixed-price menu with a starter, main, and drink for a fraction of the cost of tourist restaurants.</p>

      <h2>Exploring Beyond Florence</h2>
      <p>Italy’s train network makes day trips easy. From Florence, you can reach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pisa</strong> — to climb the famous Leaning Tower.</li>
        <li><strong>Siena</strong> — to walk through medieval streets and visit Piazza del Campo.</li>
        <li><strong>Rome</strong> — Italy’s capital, full of ancient monuments and lively streets.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rome Highlights</h2>
      <p>Rome offers layers of history. Stand in the Colosseum where gladiators once fought, throw a coin into the Trevi Fountain to ensure your return, and tour the Vatican Museums to see Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel. Each district has its own charm — Trastevere is bohemian, Monti is trendy, and Centro Storico is pure history.</p>
