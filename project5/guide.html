      <h2>Florence Highlights</h2>
      <p>Start at Piazza del Duomo, where the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore dominates the skyline. Climb the dome for panoramic views, then wander toward Piazza della Signoria — the open-air museum of Florence. End your day at the Ponte Vecchio, a medieval bridge lined with small jewelry shops and a perfect sunset view.</p>

      <h2>What to Eat</h2>
      <p>Italian food in Florence goes beyond pizza and pasta. Try a <em>panino</em> from a local sandwich shop or a bowl of <em>ribollita</em>, a hearty Tuscan soup made with bread and vegetables. For dessert, treat yourself to authentic gelato — the creamy kind made in small batches. The best spots are usually away from the main tourist streets.</p>

      <h2>Rome Monuments</h2>
      <p>If your travels continue south, Rome awaits with its iconic landmarks: the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, and Vatican City. The city mixes ruins and modern life effortlessly. Grab a cappuccino near the Pantheon and enjoy people-watching in the piazza.</p>
