      <h2>Welcome to Italy</h2>
      <p>Italy is a country filled with art, history, and tradition. Every region has its own flavor—from the pasta of Emilia-Romagna to the seafood of Sicily. Florence, located in central Tuscany, remains one of the most visited and inspiring cities in Europe. It’s not just a destination for art lovers; it’s also a living classroom for architecture, language, and culture.</p>

      <p>For many young travelers, Florence is often the first stop in Italy. Compact and walkable, it offers centuries of history within just a few square miles. You can start your day with espresso and a pastry, explore centuries-old cathedrals, and end your night with pizza or gelato under the stars. The city encourages you to slow down, wander, and discover beauty in everyday moments.</p>

      <h2>Why Florence Stands Out</h2>
      <p>Florence, known locally as <em>Firenze</em>, is the birthplace of the Renaissance. Visionaries such as Leonardo da Vinci, Dante Alighieri, and Michelangelo once called it home. The city’s museums and architecture reveal how art, science, and faith intersected to change the world. From the red-tiled dome of the Duomo to the quiet bridges over the Arno River, Florence blends history and humanity unlike anywhere else.</p>

      <p>Students visiting Florence will find a city full of learning opportunities. Art schools, cultural workshops, and language exchanges welcome international participants. Whether you’re sketching statues in Piazza della Signoria or studying Italian over a cappuccino, Florence invites you to engage, not just observe.</p>
