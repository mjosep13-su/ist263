      <h2>Getting to Know Florence</h2>
      <p>Florence sits along the Arno River and is often called the “Cradle of the Renaissance.” It’s home to masterpieces like Michelangelo’s <em>David</em>, Botticelli’s <em>Birth of Venus</em>, and Brunelleschi’s dome. But beyond the museums, you’ll find open-air markets, student-friendly cafes, and a culture that encourages slow living and appreciation of beauty.</p>
